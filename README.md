# Student Performance Prediction 🎓📊

This is my first machine learning project! 🚀 It aims to predict student performance based on various factors using machine learning techniques.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores how different factors influence student performance. It uses machine learning models to analyze and predict student outcomes.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- Machine Learning (e.g., Scikit-Learn)
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data analysis and visualization)

## 📂 Files in This Project

- `Stu_Performance_Prediction.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook with the full project, including data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- `Student_Performance.csv` - Dataset containing student performance data.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Stu_Performance_Prediction.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the cells step by step to see the data analysis, training, and predictions.

## 📊 Results

The model provides insights into factors affecting student performance and makes predictions based on input features.
